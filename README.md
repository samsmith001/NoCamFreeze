# NoCamFreeze
 
NoCamFreeze is a standalone mod that disables camera freezing when frozen in SA-MP or by another mod. This is done through switching out the variable used for tracking if controls are disabled for the player in functions
that handle camera movement. There are many other ways to reenable camera movement â€” this is merely an example of one of them.

This can be built in to a Visual Studio solution using premake5.
